Ahhh, and good and old (or not so old) statistics.

I create this software to help with my homework. In the end, just by doing it I was able to learn much more about statistical models. :)

Also, this software was my first attempt in create something with Python GUI, Tkinter. Wow, compared to Swing this one is like heaven!
