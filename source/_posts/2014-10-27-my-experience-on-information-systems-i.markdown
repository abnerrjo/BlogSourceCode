On Information Systems I we learn about project design and web systems.

There, we utilize a framework called Play!, that is done for Java and Scala.

Play! Framework is excellent, and the integration part with Scala really helps, turning things smoother.

Here are some web systems I developed during this discipline:

Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/felipemdrs/Partiu_Projeto_SI1">https://github.com/felipemdrs/Partiu_Projeto_SI1</a></center><br/>

That was the discipline's final project and it was made together with a classmate, [Felipe Miranda](https://github.com/felipemdrs).
Basically, it is a "social network" of travels, where you create a group for you travel and call people to share information about it, very much like Facebook groups. You can set you travels as public or private.

Originally made by [Felipe Miranda](https://github.com/felipemdrs), the challenge was deal with a complete system and evolve it (of course, I couldn't be able to create such beautiful GUI :p).

I was responsible for user validation (previously there wasn't a signup option), possibility to add an event place and check it as priority for experienced programmer. Another thing I learned during this project was how to work with AJAX technology.

## Final thoughts
My experience while on this discipline was very positive. My knowledge with web systems was from zero to now the possibility to create pretty complex sites. :P

I learnt many technologies (Play!, MVC, Heroku, Hibernate, AJAX, Javascript, just to quote few :P) and there's still many to learn! Well... That's a programmer life. But it's better that way.

That's it. See ya!
