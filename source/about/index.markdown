I'm a Machine Learning Engineer working at an awesome robotics startup here in Brazil. I got my Master's in Computer Science at the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://inf.ufrgs.br), where I worked on point clouds and machine learning. 

My main interests are computer vision, artificial intelligence and digital signal processing.

My other (less known) interests are in thinking about how many ways mankind can be destroyed, what's the correct way to eat a [coxinha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxinha) and how to find meaning in a meaningless universe.

Oh, I almost forgot, but I also have a pet robot:
