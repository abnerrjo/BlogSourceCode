I'm a Computer Science bachelor since 2017 by the [Universidade Federal de Campina Grande](http://www.ufcg.edu.br/), Brazil. Currently I'm pursuing a master's degree at [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul](http://inf.ufrgs.br).

My main interests are computer vision, artificial intelligence and digital signal processing.

My other (less known) interests are in thinking about how many ways mankind can be destroyed, what's the correct way to eat a [coxinha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxinha) and how to find meaning in a meaningless universe.
